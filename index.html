            This is NOT a research or report. These are just my notes as I work
            through some questions. Feel free to
            <a href="https://github.com/prtksxna/knowledgepie-experiments/issues/new">
              let me know
            </a>
            if there is something I should look at, or if I have missed
            anything.

          These experiments have two main objectives. One, is to find different
          ways to categorize and break-up the knowledge on Wikipedia. And second,
          is to use these categories to make report cards for each of the
          language wikis. Both objectives have significant challenges and unknowns.
        </p>

        <p>
          We'll start by using the Vital Articles
          list<label for="sn-in-his-later-books" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
          <span class="sidenote">
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Vital_articles">
              Vital articles
            </a>
            are lists of subjects for which the English Wikipedia should have
            corresponding featured-class articles.
          </span>
          on English Wikipedia. This list has five levels starting from just 10
          articles going up to 50,000. We'll use this list as the basis of the
          first report cards. The lists themselves will need to be analyzed for
          equity and biases.
        </p>

        <p>
          After studying the Vital Articles list we'll find their corresponding
          Wikidata items, particularly the <code>instance of</code>
          property<label for="sn-in-his-later-books" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>.
          <span class="sidenote">
            The <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P31">instance of</a>
            property describes, "<em>that class of which this subject is a
            particular example and member</em>"
          </span>
          This might give us an overview of the <em>kinds</em> of articles in
          the Vital list and not just the articles themselves. We'll then use
          these categories to make analyze the language wikis.
        </p>

        <p>
          The categories structure for each wiki might be significantly
          different from one another because of linguisting, cultural, and
          historical reasons. We'll have to devise methods to gain insight into
          these differences. The reports cards would have to consider these
          differences too, and the comparisons made across wikis should keep
          these considerations in mind.
